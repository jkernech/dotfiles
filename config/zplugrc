# Sorted in order of appearance (new at the bottom):
zplug 'zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting'

# (but it is not for me)
# zplug "zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions"

# Install plugins if there are plugins that have not been installed:
if ! zplug check; then
  zplug install

# Then, source plugins and add commands to $PATH
zplug load
